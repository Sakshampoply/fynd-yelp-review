    "# Task 1: Rating Prediction via Prompting\n",
    "This notebook implements three different prompting approaches (Zero-shot, Few-shot, Role-based) to classify Yelp reviews into 1-5 star ratings using the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approaches\n",
    "1. **Zero-shot**: Direct classification without examples.\n",
    "2. **Few-shot**: Classification with 3 static examples.\n",
    "3. **Role-based**: System instruction setting a specific persona.\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "Ensure you have a `.env` file with `GEMINI_API_KEY` and the `yelp_reviews.csv` dataset in the root directory."

      "Review: I went here this morning for breakfast with the BF to use our living social deal. We had been to black bear before about 6 years ago in glendale and then again maybe 4 years ago up in Washington state. The last time we went, we were not terribly thrilled with the place. Anyway, we decided to give them another shot and it was pretty decent. I had the shasta scramble, which has avocado, onion, bell pepper, and spinach. This was good, it was not the most flavorful scramble I have ever had, but the veggies were fresh and I liked that this was an option on their menu because most places only have one veggie scramble and it has tons of veggies thrown in with no reason for those veg to go together...anyway, the breakfast came with a ton of country potatoes which I liked more than the typical hash brown. The BF got the one biscuit and gravy breakfast and he said it was alright, not the best ever, but not bad. I thought breakfast here was better than Denny's or Ihop, but clearly not as good as the Farmhouse or Liberty Market and the like of local breakfast places. The service was also good, but I thought it was so weird because our waitress kept calling us 'kids' and calling me sweetie, princess, and honey. I find this somewhat condescending, not that I think that was her intention, but I think that is unnecessary. I know this is kind of a diner thing, but I have never really cared for us, but maybe that's just me. The waitress was good at her job and attentive though, so that is what's important. Also, the portions are huge and I wish they had more options for half meals because I don't like to waste food, but I know people like the giant portion thing.... I would probably come back here for breakfast again sometime, however, because it is decently priced and has decent flavor.\n",

They explicitly state it was 'better than Denny's or Ihop,' which sets a baseline of acceptability. The criticisms are minor – the scramble wasn't *the most* flavorful, the boyfriend found his meal 'alright,' and the waitress's terms of endearment were slightly off-putting. However, these are balanced by praise for fresh vegetables, the country potatoes, good service (despite the nickname issue), and large portions. The concluding statement – 'I would probably come back here for breakfast again sometime' – is a strong indicator of overall satisfaction, even if not enthusiastic. The comparison to higher-rated local spots ('Farmhouse or Liberty Market') positions Black Bear as a step below those, but still a worthwhile option, supporting a 3-star rating.\"}\n"
