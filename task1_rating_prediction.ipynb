    "# Task 1: Rating Prediction via Prompting\n",
    "This notebook implements three different prompting approaches (Zero-shot, Few-shot, Role-based) to classify Yelp reviews into 1-5 star ratings using the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approaches\n",
    "1. **Zero-shot**: Direct classification without examples.\n",
    "2. **Few-shot**: Classification with 3 static examples.\n",
    "3. **Role-based**: System instruction setting a specific persona.\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "Ensure you have a `.env` file with `GEMINI_API_KEY` and the `yelp_reviews.csv` dataset in the root directory."
